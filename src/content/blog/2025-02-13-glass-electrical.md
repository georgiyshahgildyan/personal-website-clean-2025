At room temperature, most glasses are excellent insulators. This is because their electrons are tightly bound within the silicate network. However, glass is not "dead" electrically. It can conduct electricity through the movement of ions—primarily small, positively charged ions like Sodium (Na+).

As glass is heated, these ions gain enough energy to "hop" from one site in the amorphous network to another, causing the electrical resistance to drop dramatically. In fact, molten glass is quite conductive, a property used in "electric boosting" for industrial glass furnaces.

Understanding these ion dynamics is crucial for designing glass for electronics, where we often want to minimize ion movement to prevent degradation, and for new energy technologies like solid-state batteries, where we want the ions to move as fast as possible.
