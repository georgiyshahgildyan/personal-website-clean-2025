Many microdevices require a stable internal atmosphere. Moisture and contamination can shift sensor calibration, degrade resonators, or damage micro-optical components. Glass sealing is widely studied because glass can form hermetic barriers and integrate with microfabrication and packaging approaches.

The main scientific challenge is stress management. A seal that looks perfect at room temperature can crack after thermal cycling if thermal expansion mismatch creates tensile stress in the wrong region. Defects like bubbles, poor wetting, and interfacial contamination also compromise hermeticity long before the bulk material fails.

This is why sealing is not “just assembly.” It is a materials design problem involving viscosity control during joining, thermal scheduling, and interface chemistry. Glass composition must match the thermal budget and the substrate system, or reliability will suffer.

If you’re working on microdevice packaging, hermeticity, or glass joining, I can help you analyze the stress landscape, choose suitable glass families, and define a processing route that reduces risk and improves long-term stability.
