Despite thousands of years of history, many of the most basic questions about glass remain unanswered. We still don't fully understand the "glass transition" from a mathematical perspective—some call it the deepest and most interesting unsolved problem in solid-state theory.

The future of glass research lies in moving beyond simple silicate compositions. We are exploring glasses made of metals, polymers, and even organic molecules. We are using Artificial Intelligence to predict "un-meltable" compositions that could have properties beyond our wildest dreams.

From glass that can store 1,000 times more data than a hard drive to glass that can repair itself when scratched, the potential is limitless. As we enter the "Age of Glass," this ancient material is proving to be more modern and more essential than ever before.
