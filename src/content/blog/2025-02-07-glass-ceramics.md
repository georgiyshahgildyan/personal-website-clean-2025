Glass-ceramics are a unique class of materials that start their life as glass but are later transformed into a partially crystalline material through a carefully controlled heat treatment. This process, known as devitrifaction, allows us to grow billions of tiny crystals inside the glass matrix.

The resulting material often possesses properties that neither pure glass nor pure ceramics can provide. For example, some glass-ceramics have an "ultra-low thermal expansion," meaning they don't expand or contract when heated. This makes them perfect for cooktops, telescope mirrors, and dental restorations.

By controlling the size and type of crystals, we can also make glass-ceramics that are exceptionally strong, tough, or even transparent despite being crystalline. They truly represent the pinnacle of "engineered" materials in the world of silicates.
