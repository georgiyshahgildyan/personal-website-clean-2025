Vitrification is the first step in nuclear waste disposal, but the storage canister is just as important. Once the radioactive waste is melted into glass, it is poured into heavy-duty stainless steel canisters. These aren't just buckets; they are precision-engineered vessels designed for extreme longevity.

The glass provides the "chemical" containment—preventing individual atoms from moving. The steel canister provides the "mechanical" containment—protecting the glass from physical impacts or water contact for the first few hundred years while the radiation levels are highest.

Together, the glass and the canister form a "multibarrier system." Even if the steel were eventually to corrode after centuries, the glass block inside would remain solid and stable for thousands more years, ensuring that the waste remains isolated from the biosphere effectively forever.
