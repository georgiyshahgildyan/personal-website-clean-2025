We often take the transparency of glass for granted, but it is actually a consequence of its unique atomic structure. In most crystalline materials, light is scattered at the boundaries between tiny crystals (grains), making the material appear opaque or translucent.

Glass, being amorphous, lacks these grain boundaries. Furthermore, the electronic structure of most silicate glasses is such that the energy required to excite an electron (the band gap) is much higher than the energy of visible light photons. Therefore, visible light passes through without being absorbed.

However, transparency can be "tuned." By adding transition metal ions or rare-earth elements, we can create colored glasses that absorb specific wavelengths, or by inducing controlled crystallization (forming glass-ceramics), we can create materials that range from crystal clear to milky white.
