Photonic crystals are to light what semiconductors are to electricity. By creating a perfectly periodic arrangement of glass and air holes, we can create a "Photonic Bandgap"—a range of light colors that simply cannot pass through the material.

This allows us to guide light around tight corners with zero loss, or to create "optical fibers" that are mostly air but still trap light in their center. These specialized fibers are used in high-power laser delivery and ultra-precise clocks that are billions of times more accurate than a standard wristwatch.

While nature does this in the iridescent colors of butterfly wings and opals, humans are now building these structures in glass for high-tech applications. By controlling the geometry of the pattern, we can dictate exactly how light moves, creating the foundation for the "all-optical" computers of the future.
