For high-power semiconductor devices like those found in electric vehicle chargers or solar inverters, simply "protecting" the chip isn't enough. We need to "passivate" it. Passivation is the process of neutralizing the reactive chemical bonds on the surface of the semiconductor.

Specialized "passivation glasses" are melted directly onto the semiconductor surface. These glasses are designed to have an expansion coefficient that matches the silicon exactly, preventing cracks during temperature changes. They also contain very few "mobile" ions that could drift and cause electrical leakage.

By sealing the semiconductor junction with these high-purity glasses, manufacturers can create devices that operate at hundreds of volts and high temperatures for decades, a requirement for the transition to a sustainable energy future.
