The glass transition temperature, or Tg, is arguably the most important property of any glass. It is the temperature range where a material transitions from a hard, brittle "glassy" state into a more pliable, viscous "rubbery" or molten state as it is heated.

Unlike crystals, which have a sharp melting point, glass softens gradually. At Tg, the atomic network gains enough thermal energy to allow for structural relaxation. This has profound implications for processing: glass must be annealed near its Tg to remove internal stresses that could otherwise lead to spontaneous shattering.

For scientists, Tg is not a fixed constant but depends on the cooling rate. Faster cooling leads to a higher Tg and a less dense structure, a phenomenon that allows us to tune the properties of glass for specific applications.
