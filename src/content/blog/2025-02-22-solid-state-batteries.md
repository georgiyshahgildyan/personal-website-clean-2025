The next revolution in energy storage isn't a better liquid, but a solid. Current lithium-ion batteries use a flammable liquid electrolyte, which is why they can occasionally catch fire. Solid-state batteries replace this liquid with a solid layer—and glass is one of the top candidates for the job.

Glassy solid electrolytes have several advantages. They are non-flammable, they can block the growth of "dendrites" (tiny metal spikes that cause short circuits), and they are easy to manufacture in thin layers. Most importantly, the disordered structure of glass provides many paths for ions to move through, which is essential for fast charging.

By using specialized sulfide or phosphate glasses, researchers are reaching ionic conductivities that rival liquids. If successful, glass-based batteries could double the range of electric cars while making them as safe as a standard AA battery.
