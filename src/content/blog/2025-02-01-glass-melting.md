Glass melting is one of the most remarkable transformations in materials science. It begins with a mixture of raw materials—typically sand, soda ash, and limestone—which are heated to temperatures exceeding 1500°C. At these temperatures, the crystalline structures of the raw materials break down into a disordered, molten liquid.

The magic happens during cooling. If we cool the melt slowly, it would crystallize back into a stone-like material. But by cooling it rapidly, we "freeze" the liquid's disordered atomic structure into a solid state. This is the glass transition.

The resulting material is technically an amorphous solid, possessing the structural randomness of a liquid but the mechanical rigidity of a solid. This unique state is what allows glass to be so versatile, from fiber optics to medical implants.
