Spray drying is a scalable method to convert liquid feed into controlled powder granules. For glass and glass-ceramic materials, powder quality affects sintering behavior, flowability, densification, and the reliability of downstream manufacturing. It is also relevant for additive manufacturing feedstocks, where particle morphology can decide whether printing is stable or chaotic.

The scientific interest lies in the coupling between chemistry and kinetics. Slurry composition, viscosity, drying rate, and binder choice influence granule porosity and strength. Those features then affect packing density and how the powder behaves under heat treatment. This is why powder engineering is a key part of materials science rather than a “pre-processing detail.”

Researchers optimize spray drying because it helps control variability. Uniform powders lead to more uniform microstructures, which in turn improves reproducibility of mechanical and functional properties. That chain—from powder to microstructure to performance—is exactly how glass-based materials research creates reliable technologies.

If you’re preparing glass powders for sintering, coatings, or glass-ceramics, I can help you think through particle design, process parameters, and characterization so the powders behave predictably in your target process.
